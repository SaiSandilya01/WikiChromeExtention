That’s right…by making the decision to go passwordless, you will limit the hassle of resetting forgotten passwords. Instead, you will have the opportunity to create a passkey that is unique to your specific device which you can use each time you access your account.\n\nIn reality, passwords put you more at risk due to the use of the same password for multiple accounts, especially if your password is ever stolen. Removing the need to use a password will add security to your account and better protect your TIAA assets.\n\nIf you choose to go passwordless, the experience is easy. Once prompted, you’ll be guided through a few simple steps to create your passkey using the biometric capabilities of your device.\n\nOnce you have created your passkey you now have a simpler, safer, and more seamless way to access your accounts.\n\nFor more information on how to stay safe online visit [tiaa.org/security](https://www.tiaa.org/security \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n[Read more\\\\\nOpens pdf](https://www.tiaa.org/public/pdf/t/tiaa-passwordless-flyer.pdf)\n\n## Accounts are protected from unauthorized access\n\nTIAA's log-in security strategy provides faster and more accurate prevention and detection of cybercriminal access techniques.\n\n- 24x7 security monitoring alerts us to potential issues\n- Industry threat intelligence helps us stay ahead of attacks\n- Established technologies provide efficient prevention, detection and response\n- Multifactor authentication (MFA) is always on to help ensure only you can log into your account\n\n\n![](https://www.tiaa.org/content/dam/tiaa/public/images/dummy-img.png)\n\n### Something you know\n\nLike your username, password, SSN or date of birth\n\n![](https://www.tiaa.org/content/dam/tiaa/public/images/dummy-img.png)\n\n### Something you have\n\nLike your registered laptop, smartphone or tablet PC\n\n![](https://www.tiaa.org/content/dam/tiaa/public/images/dummy-img.png)\n\n### Something you are\n\nLike voice, facial or fingerprint biometrics\n\n### Further strengthen your authentication\n\nAdditional verification factors can be added for increased account security.\n\n[Add factors\\\\\nOpens in new window](https://auth.tiaa.org/public/authentication/securityprofile)\n\n[See how](https://www.tiaa.org/public/support/security-center/multifactor-authentication-video)\n\n### Add a Trusted Contact\n\nA Trusted Contact is someone age 18 or older who you know and trust who will act as a point of contact should we become concerned about your well-being, whereabouts, or in extreme circumstances, where we suspect you may be the victim of fraud or exploitation.\n\n[Add a Trusted Contact\\\\\nOpens in new window](https://shared.tiaa.org/private/partprofile/trustedcontacts/home)\n\nAssurance\n\n## TIAA provides assurance if an incident occurs\n\nYou are reimbursed for any loss due to unauthorized access.\\*\n\n- View TIAA's [Customer Protection Policy](https://www.tiaa.org/public/support/security-center/customer-protection-policy)\n- State and Federal law-based incident response and notifications\n- Credit monitoring and identity theft repair if your data is breached\n- Regulatory oversight, independent audit and certification of alignment with industry expectations\n\n\nResources\n\n## Resources to protect your online interactions\n\nStrengthen your defenses against cybercriminals by increasing awareness and remaining vigilant.\n\nCybersecurity Videos\n\n![](https://www.tiaa.org/content/dam/tiaa/public/images/dummy-img.png)\n\nPlay video\n\nKeeping Older Adults Secure\n\n![](https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/jit/1215934396001/067e4d5f-0aec-4246-948e-4b5275e9bf4b/main/1280x720/28s853ms/match/image.jpg)\n\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlaySkip BackwardSkip Forward\n\nMute\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\n/\n\nDuration 0:57\n\nLoaded: 10.33%\n\n0:00\n\nStream Type LIVE\n\nSeek to live, currently behind liveLIVE\n\nRemaining Time -0:57\n\n1x\n\nPlayback Rate\n\n- 2x\n- 1.75x\n- 1.5x\n- 1.25x\n- 1x, selected\n- 0.75x\n- 0.5x\n\nChapters\n\n- Chapters\n\nDescriptions\n\n- descriptions off, selected\n\nCaptions\n\n- captions settings, opens captions settings dialog\n- captions off, selected\n\nAudio Track\n\n- en (main), selected\n\nFullscreen\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\n## The video connection was lost, please confirm you are connected to the internet\n\n**Error Code:** MEDIA\\_ERR\\_NETWORK\n\nTechnical details\n:\n\nHLS playlist request error at URL: https://manifest.prod.boltdns.net/manifest/v1/hls/v4/clear/1215934396001/067e4d5f-0aec-4246-948e-4b5275e9bf4b/10s/master.m3u8?fastly\\_token=Njg3ZjhjMmZfYmUyMTJlODYxOTA5NGU1YWJjYjI2YmFhM2YzMjY1NGFiOWYyMTRlNDBhZTliYWNiYWVhNzQzMmNjYjFjOTM4Ng%3D%3D.\n\n**Session ID:** 2025-07-22:c3133e7cca4c56d1c566f997 **Player Element ID:** video-1542812433\n\nOK\n\nClose Modal Dialog\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

Maybe you've noticed a sudden change in its speed or more popups. These could be signs your computer is infected with malware. Malware is software used to disrupt a computer, server, or network. It is one of the biggest threats to the security of your devices. Malware includes viruses, spyware, ransomware, and other unwanted software that gets secretly installed onto your device. Malware is installed in several ways. These include infected removable media, like USB thumb drives, internet downloads, clicking on suspicious links and attachments. Cyber criminals use malware to steal sensitive information, gain unauthorized access to files, and interfere with device privacy and safety. They may also be able to gain access to your financial accounts and ultimately steal your money. In addition to performance changes and popups, other signs of malware include repeated, unusual error messages, your device won't shut down or restart, unexpected low battery life and the inability to remove software. What should you do if you suspect your device is infected with malware? One, download a reputable anti-malware software and get offline immediately.

It is important to familiarize yourself with typical scam tactics, prevention techniques, and what to do if you believe you or someone you know has been impacted. Their schemes can start with a call, text, email, or even a social media message. Often, scammers use spoofing to make their calls look like a legitimate IRS phone number. They will try to convince you that you owe back taxes or there’s a problem with your tax return. Scammers play on your fears and try to convince you to rectify the problem by paying immediately…and if you don’t, will threaten you with jail or large monetary penalties. They might even use the opportunity to convince you to share your personal information. The IRS will always begin communication with an official letter in the mail…never a call, text, email or social media message. Additionally, the IRS will never ask for payment in the form of gift cards, money transfers, or cryptocurrency. You can call the IRS at [1-800-829-1040](tel:1-800-829-1040 \"Call 1-800-829-1040\") to verify the legitimacy of any IRS related communications you receive. If you receive an unsolicited communication from a scammer do not respond. Instead, visit the IRS website for information on how to make a report.  Also, consider reporting to the Federal Trade Commission, and lastly, for more information on how to protect yourself, visit the TIAA Security Center at [TIAA.org/security](https://www.tiaa.org/public/support/security-center).\n\n![](https://www.tiaa.org/content/dam/tiaa/public/images/dummy-img.png)\n\nPlay video\n\nFraud and Scams\n\n![](https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/jit/1215934396001/eb9f4a8c-13dd-4585-86d9-2aeffa7515e0/main/1280x720/52s288ms/match/image.jpg)\n\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlaySkip BackwardSkip Forward\n\nMute\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\n/\n\nDuration 1:44\n\nLoaded: 5.70%\n\n0:00\n\nStream Type LIVE\n\nSeek to live, currently behind liveLIVE\n\nRemaining Time -1:44\n\n1x\n\nPlayback Rate\n\n- 2x\n- 1.75x\n- 1.5x\n- 1.25x\n- 1x, selected\n- 0.75x\n- 0.5x\n\nChapters\n\n- Chapters\n\nDescriptions\n\n- descriptions off, selected\n\nCaptions\n\n- captions settings, opens captions settings dialog\n- captions off, selected\n\nAudio Track\n\n- en (main), selected\n\nFullscreen\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\n## The video connection was lost, please confirm you are connected to the internet\n\n**Error Code:** MEDIA\\_ERR\\_NETWORK\n\nTechnical details\n:\n\nHLS playlist request error at URL: https://manifest.prod.boltdns.net/manifest/v1/hls/v4/clear/1215934396001/eb9f4a8c-13dd-4585-86d9-2aeffa7515e0/10s/master.m3u8?fastly\\_token=Njg3ZjhjNjZfYTc5MGU0MWUwODAxMzY1ZWUyNmVmOTA0OGU4NzBiODdkYjA4MGIwZmNiOTZkNGYyYzFiYzJiZWI2MjJkNDdhOA%3D%3D.\n\n**Session ID:** 2025-07-22:1016afa5eaa5c9114ca99d6b **Player Element ID:** video-95676222\n\nOK\n\nClose Modal Dialog\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

You receive a phone call, text, or email you weren't expecting, but the contents make you pause and pay attention. The message you receive makes your heart race or you might wonder if you're in trouble. The message seems urgent, and wants your attention and action immediately. It seems bizarre, but the message is convincing you that you should act and fast. You're not alone with these types of messages. These are all common traits of scams. Scammers use common tactics no matter what the scam is. Scams utilize common tactics such as a sense of urgency. The message, whether email, text, or phone will convince you that you must act and rectify a situation or take advantage of some benefit. With the sense of urgency, tactics might also be used. This could include convincing you that something has happened to a loved one or that you must send money right away. The sender, a caller might request payment in unusual payment methods such as gift cards or tell you that you've been overpaid for a product or service and must return the extra amount. If you receive a phone call, text, or email with any of these common trades, hang up, delete, or ignore the message altogether. Someone is trying to scam you. Remember, being informed and vigilant is the best way to avoid scams. Stay safe and never give into these fraudulent schemes. If you are the recipient of a scam attempt you can report it to the Federal Trade Commission.
